Please do not file an issue if you would like a plugin for your music streaming service.
If you are a developer and you have an issue with a specific service, then file the issue here:
Tidal: https://github.com/svbnet/AthamePlugin.Tidal/issues/new
Google Play Music: https://github.com/svbnet/AthamePlugin.GooglePlayMusic/issues/new
Otherwise, it's fine to file it here :)

If you've found a bug, please answer these questions:
What is your OS version?
Have you deleted your config file? Paste the path `%appdata%\Athame` into the Windows Explorer address bar then delete the `settings.json` file.
Have you ensured you are using the latest version?
Can you play back the track or collection on the web?
