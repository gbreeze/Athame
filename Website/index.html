			<p>Athame is a program for downloading music from streaming services like Tidal and Google Play Music. It is <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/svbnet/Athame">open-source</a> and free for personal use.
			It is currently in alpha and requires Microsoft Windows and .NET (though it does kind of work on Linux with Mono).</p>

			<h2>Disclaimer &amp; download</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Athame is alpha software, which means it could break at any time.</li>
				<li>You must not share or redistribute any content downloaded with Athame.</li>
				<li>Athame attempts to replicate the function of the "offline download" feature many music streaming apps have. Therefore, when your music streaming service subscription ends, you are obliged to delete any content you have downloaded to your computer or device.</li>
				<li>Athame uses internal APIs, which means they are subject to change at the discretion of the streaming service provider.</li>

			<h2>Older releases &amp; notes</h2>
			<p><strong>Note:</strong> Config file migration has not yet been implemented, so upgrading or downgrading will likely
			cause Athame to crash or overwrite your config file. Config files can be found at <code>%appdata%\Athame</code> on Windows,
			or <code>~/.config/Athame</code> on Linux/OS X.</p>

					<h3 class="relTitle"><a href="https://github.com/svbnet/Athame/releases/tag/0.4.6">Athame 0.4.6</a></h3>
					<small class="version">0.4.6</small>
				</header>
				<p class="relNotes"><p>The plugin API has not changed, so plugins that worked in 0.4.5 will work in this version.</p>
<p>New users are advised to download the zip file ending in <code>-base-plugins.zip</code>. Otherwise, the zip file ending in the version number can be unzipped directly into your existing program directory.</p>
<ul>
<li>
#74 et al - Fix messed up default playlist path format. <strong>Existing users need to change the path format to <code>{PlaylistName}/{Title} - {AlbumArtistOrArtist}</code> or a similar format for this to work</strong>.
</li>
<li>
#85 - long file names. See <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/266621/how-to-make-windows-10-accept-file-paths-over-260-characters/">this article</a> for enabling long file names on Windows 10 Anniversary Edition or later. Note that the code that tries to truncate long file names on earlier platforms is primitive, and may not work if you have a long download destination.
</li>
<li>
#93 - groups now display the total number of tracks in them, as well as the total number of available tracks.
</li>
<li>
#96 - there is now an option in settings to download a M3U or PLS playlist of each collection queued. Due to the way the path format system works, the playlist file is saved in the destination directory. For instance, if the destination directory is your Music folder and your path format is <code>{Artist}/{Album}</code>, the playlist will be saved in your Music folder, and named the same as the collection.
</li>
<li>
#97 - Athame now alerts you if there are items in the queue that haven't been downloaded yet. There is an option to disable this in settings.
</li>
<li>
#95 - The queue can now be scrolled while downloading.
</li>
<li>
#99 - Fixed the issue where the optional "Genre" track property wasn't checked for null before being set in the tag.
</li>
<li>Fixed issue where the album artwork download option <code>{Track} {Album}.ext</code> doesn't validate the album artwork path.</li>
<li>Fixed issue where exception dialog doesn't appear on double click</li>
<li>Added an option for album art to not be saved when downloading playlist</li>
<li>Update licenses in about box</li>
</ul>
<p>A sincere thank you to everyone who starred this repo, filed an issue, downloaded a copy, or gave a donation/thank you. Your continued support motivates me to continually improve Athame in my limited spare time, and without it I would've given up months ago.</p></p>

					<small class="version">0.4.4</small>
				</header>
				<p class="relNotes"><p>You will need to delete your Tidal config file (<code>%AppData%\Athame\Plugin Data\Tidal Settings.json</code>), since the new Tidal plugin uses a different API key to enable master quality downloads.</p>
<ul>
<li>Fix bug where downloading an album with no artwork would cause an error.</li>
<li>Fix bug where the Google Play Music plugin wouldn't work due to being unable to load the JSON library.</li>
<li>Better plugin load error handling.</li>
<li>Files are now downloaded with prefix -temp on the filename, then renamed to the correct name when completed. This is to prevent programs like the Google Play Music Manager from attempting to upload a file while it's still being downloaded.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>Tidal plugin: Enable master quality (MQA) downloads. Just choose the "Master" quality option in settings.</li>
<li>You will need to delete your Tidal config file (<code>%AppData%\Athame\Plugin Data\Tidal Settings.json</code>), since the new Tidal plugin uses a different API key to enable master quality downloads.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>Developers: Plugin API version 2 is now supported, which introduces the <code>Picture</code> abstract class instead of the <code>CoverUri</code> property, as well as paginated records. See the documentation wiki for more details.</li>

					<small class="version">0.4.3-1</small>
				</header>
				<p class="relNotes"><p><strong>Note: This release will reset your settings.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fix issue where loading plugins on a system with .NET 4.7 installed would cause a <code>NotSupportedException</code> to be thrown.</li>
<li>Remove type information from main settings, and put plugin settings in a separate file. This fixes the issue where settings cannot be parsed after a plugin is removed.</li>
<li>Breaking changes for the plugin API.</li>
</ul>
<p>The default release archive does not contain any plugins by default. For legacy users, the <code>athame-0.4.3-base-plugins.zip</code> release is available, which includes the Tidal and Google Play Music services.</p>
<p>Both the <a href="https://github.com/svbnet/AthamePlugin.Tidal">Tidal</a> and <a href="https://github.com/svbnet/AthamePlugin.GooglePlayMusic">Google Play Music</a> service plugins are available from their respective repositories, on the Releases tab. In the future, I will also promote other plugins that can be optionally installed.</p>
<p>To install a plugin, just extract it into the "Plugins" folder in the same directory as the executable.</p></p>
